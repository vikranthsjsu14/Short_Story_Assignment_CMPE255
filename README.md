This assignment is about a short story. I chose an article about LLMs challenges and solutions ifluenced by authors: Baolin Li, Yankai Jiang, Vijay Gadepally. 

The article's abstract: This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems, focusing on research since the year 2023. We specifically examine system-level enhancements that improve performance and efficiency without altering the core LLM decoding mech- anisms. By selecting and reviewing high-quality papers from prestigious ML and system venues, we highlight key innovations and practical considerations for deploying and scaling LLMs in real-world production environments. This survey serves as a valuable resource for LLM practitioners seeking to stay abreast of the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field.
